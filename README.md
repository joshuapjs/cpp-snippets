# Cpp-Snippets

This is a collection of (cool) little programs I implemented to practice writing C++. By now I implemented some Algorithms, but there are different programs to be added in the future. As I am still learning, my code might not be optimized perfectly yet. However I intend to optimize it whenever I have gained a deeper understanding about how C++ works.

This repository is also indended to be a reference for popular algorithms in CS.
Please feel free to contribute - I am always very happy about ideas and hints for further improvement.
