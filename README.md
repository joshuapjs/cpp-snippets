# dsa-in-cpp

This is a collection of little programs I implemented to practice writing C++.

## About

By now I implemented some Algorithms, but there are different programs to be added in the future. As I am still learning, my code might not be optimized perfectly yet. However I intend to optimize it whenever I have gained a deeper understanding about how C++ works. This Repository is also indended to be a reference for popular algorithms in CS.

## Contribution

Please feel free to contribute - I am always very happy about ideas and hints for further improvement.
